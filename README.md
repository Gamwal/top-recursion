## Recursion Algorithms

### Description:

This repository contains implementations of two fundamental recursion algorithms in JavaScript:

1. Fibonacci Sequence:

   - Calculates the Fibonacci sequence using both iterative and recursive approaches.
   - Demonstrates the concept of recursion and the potential for performance optimization using iterative solutions.

2. Merge Sort:
   - Implements the Merge Sort algorithm for sorting arrays.
   - Illustrates the divide-and-conquer paradigm and the efficiency of Merge Sort compared to other sorting algorithms.

### Usage:

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gamwal/top-recursion.git
   ```
2. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the Code:
   ```bash
   $ node fibonacci.js
   $ node mergesort.js
   ```

### File Structure:

- `fibonacci.js`: Contains the implementations of the Fibonacci sequence algorithm, along with example usage.
- `mergesort.js`: Contains the implementations of the Merge Sort algorithm, along with example usage.
